          Black coffee is as simple as it gets with ground coffee beans steeped in hot water, served warm. And if you want to
          sound fancy, you can call black coffee by its proper name: cafe noir. Since it isnâ€™t doctored up with milk or sugar, the
          quality of coffee is especially important.
