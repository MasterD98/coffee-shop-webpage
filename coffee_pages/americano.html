        <h1>Americano</h1>
        <h2>Origin</h2>
        <p>
          "Americano" means "American" in Italian, Spanish and Portuguese.[2] It
          entered the English language from Italian in the 1970s.[3][4][5][6]
          "Caffè Americano" specifically is Italian for "American coffee".[7]
          There is a popular but unconfirmed belief that the name has its
          origins in World War II when American G.I.s in Italy diluted espresso
          with hot water to approximate the coffee to which they were
          accustomed.[8] In his 1928 novel Ashenden: Or the British Agent,
          Somerset Maugham's protagonist orders and drinks something called an
          americano in Naples during World War I, but there is not enough
          information to indicate whether it is the same drink.[9] And in
          Maugham'1929 s short story "The Wash-Tu29, taking place in Positano,
          near Naples, "americano" appears when the narrator asks "what there
          was for dinner and drank an americano, which is by no means a bad
          substitute for a cocktail".[citation needed]
        </p>
        <h2>Preparation</h2>
        <p>
          The drink consists of a single or double shot of espresso brewed with
          added water. Typically in the UK (and in Italy) between 1 and 16
          imperial fluid ounces or 28 and 455 ml of hot water is added to the
          double espresso.[10] Long Black is an Australasian term for a drink
          similar to the Americano (in contrast to Short Black for espresso),
          with an emphasis being placed on the order of preparation, adding
          water to the cup first before pouring the espresso on top.[11] In the
          western U.S., Italiano is sometimes refers to a short Americano with
          equal amounts of espresso and water.[12] The hot water can be drawn
          directly from the same espresso machine that is used to brew the
          espresso, or from a separate water heater or kettle. Using the same
          heater makes a second one unnecessary, and the water can be drawn
          directly into the glass, either before (for a Long Black) or after
          (for an Americano) the espresso. Some espresso machines have a
          separate hot water spout for this purpose, while on others, the steam
          wand dispenses it. Using a separate water heater is more practical in
          a commercial setting, as it frees the machine for other baristas,
          avoids disrupting the brew water's temperature, and reduces wear on
          specialized equipment. Caffè Americano is brewed coffee in the
          Philippines.

        <h2>Uses</h2>
        <p>
          Most commonly, an Americano is used when one orders a brew-coffee
          sized drink from an espresso bar. Americanos—particularly short,
          long-black-style Americanos—are also used within artisanal espresso
          preparation for beans that produce strong espresso. This is
          particularly used for single origin espresso, where many find that
          undiluted espresso shots can prove overpowering; and with lighter
          coffees and roasts not generally associated with espresso, such as
          beans of Ethiopian or Sumatran origins. For this preparation,
          generally a ratio of 1:1 espresso to water is used, to prevent excess
          dilution, with the espresso pulled directly into a cup with existing
          water to minimize disruption to the crema.
