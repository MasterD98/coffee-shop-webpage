          A cappuccino (/ˌkæpʊˈtʃiːnoʊ/ (audio speaker iconlisten); Italian
          pronunciation: [kapputˈtʃiːno]; Italian plural: cappuccini) is an
          espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Austria with later
          development taking place in Italy, and is prepared with steamed milk
          foam (microfoam).[1] Variations of the drink involve the use of cream

          mostly espresso). The physical appearance of a modern cappuccino with
          espresso créma and steamed milk is a result of a long evolution of the
          drink. The Viennese bestowed the name "Kapuziner", possibly in the
          18th century, on a version that included whipped cream and spices of
          unknown origin. The Italian cappuccino was unknown outside Italy until
          the 1930s, and seems to be born out of Viennese-style cafés in Trieste
          and other Italian areas in Austria-Hungary through the Kapuziner
          coffee in the early 20th century. The drink spread from Trieste, the m
