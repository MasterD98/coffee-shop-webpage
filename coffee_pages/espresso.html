        <h1>Espresso</h1>
        <p>
          Espresso is generally thicker than coffee brewed by other methods,
          with a viscosity of warm honey. This is due to the higher
          concentration of suspended and dissolved solids, and the crema on top
          (a foam with a creamy consistency).[2] As a result of the pressurized
          brewing process, the flavors and chemicals in a typical cup of
          espresso are very concentrated. The three dispersed phases in espresso
          are what make this beverage unique. The first dispersed phase is an
          emulsion of oil droplets. The second phase is suspended solids, while
          the third is the layer of gas bubbles or foam. The dispersion of very
          small oil droplets is perceived in the mouth as creamy. This
          characteristic of espresso contributes to what is known as the body of
          the beverage. These oil droplets preserve some of the aromatic
          compounds that are lost to the air in other coffee forms. This
          preserves the strong coffee flavor present in the espresso.[3]
          Espresso is also the base for various coffee drinks—including caffè
          latte, cappuccino, caffè macchiato, caffè mocha, flat white, and caffè
          Americano. Espresso has more caffeine per unit volume than most coffee
          beverages, but because the usual serving size is much smaller, the
          total caffeine content is less than a mug of standard brewed
          coffee.[4] The actual caffeine content of any coffee drink varies by
          size, bean origin, roast method and other factors, but a typical 28
          grams (1 ounce) serving of espresso usually contains 65 milligrams of
          caffeine, whereas a typical serving of drip coffee usually contains
          150 to 200 mg
