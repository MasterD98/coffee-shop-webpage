        <h2>What Is In a Latte?</h2>
        <p>
          A latte begins with the same base â€” a single or
          double shot of espresso. This espresso is then combined with several
          ounces of steamed milk to create a rich, creamy beverage that has a
          more subtle espresso taste. The typical ratio for espresso to steamed
          milk is about 1-to-2. The latte is then topped with a layer of foam.
          The exact preparation of a latte varies widely, as their popularity
          has exploded in the last 20 years. The latte is tweaked endlessly and
          often made into a sweet version by adding flavors like Vanilla and
          Hazelnut.
