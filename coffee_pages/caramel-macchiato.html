        <h2>What is a Caramel Macchiato? </h2>
        <p>
          Starbucks deserves credit for elevating
          coffee’s popularity around the world, and it’s made such a powerful
          “mark” on cafe culture that the company rewrote the global drink
          dictionary with its Caramel Macchiato. This lush, dessert-like drink is
          a latte-style beverage served hot or iced made with milk, vanilla syrup,
          and topped with espresso and caramel sauce. Starbucks retail locations
          serve this drink in various sizes between 8oz-24oz.

        <h2>What’s the difference between a Caramel Macchiato and a traditional macchiato?</h2>
        <p>
          The traditional definition of a “macchiato” is an espresso with just a small
          bit of milk or foam (macchiato coming from the Italian, “to mark” or “to
          stain”). It’s about three ounces. Starbucks took some mixologistic
          license with the term, adding both an “espresso macchiato” (traditional)
          and a “latte macchiato” to their original menus. The Caramel Macchiato
          is essentially a not-too-sweet vanilla latte topped with caramel. The
          “macchiato” distinction is due to the fact the espresso is layered on
          top of the milk, as opposed to the Starbucks latte, which does the
          opposite. This layering is especially noticeable in transparent vessels.
          The sweet coffee treat became such a smash sensation that it’s what many
          people think of when they ask for a macchiato in a cafe. When they’re
          given a 3oz drink with no flavored syrups, boy are they surprised!
