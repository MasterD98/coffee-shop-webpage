        <h1>Black Eye</h1>
        <p>
          Black eye coffee also called a double shot in the dark, is a coffee
          drink that is gaining in popularity, especially amongst students. It
          is a unique combination of coffee and espresso, which creates a drink
          with a high intensity of flavor, and more importantly extra caffeine.
          Additionally, if you are sensitive to caffeine, we recommend avoiding
          this drink at all cost. But if you aren’t, we recommend proceeding
          with caution. We’ll tell you more about this highly potent coffee and
          its other variations, as well as how to make some for yourself if you
          dare

        <h2>What is Black Eye Coffee?</h2>
        <p>
          black eye coffee is a very simple drink. It’s a cup of normal drip
          coffee, either iced or hot, with a double shot of espresso. The name
          is said to have come from the way the coffee looks when you add the
          shots in, but we think the name comes from the fact that this drink
          feels like a punch to the face. This thing will seriously wake you up,
          and it’s obvious why.

          <em>
            A red-eye coffee or depth charge, which is a normal coffee with only a
            single shot of espresso added, can have anywhere from 250-400mg of
            caffeine in one cup.
