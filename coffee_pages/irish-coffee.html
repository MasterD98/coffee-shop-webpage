        <h1>Irish coffee</h1>
        <p>
          Different variations of coffee cocktails pre-date the now-classic
          Irish coffee by at least 100 years. From the mid-19th century, the
          Pharisäer and the Fiaker were served in Viennese coffee houses; both
          were coffee cocktails served in glass, topped with whipped cream. The
          former was also known in northern Germany and Denmark around that
          time. Around 1900, the coffee cocktail menu in the Viennese cafés also
          included Kaisermelange, Maria Theresia, Biedermeier-Kaffee and a
          handful of other variations on the theme.[citation needed] In
          19th-century France, a mixture of coffee and spirits was called a
          gloria.

        <blockquote>
          "Un trait de son caractère était de payer généreusement quinze francs
          par mois pour le gloria qu'il prenait au dessert." (Balzac, Le Père
          Goriot, 1834, I.)
          <br />
          "Il aimait le gros cidre, les gigots saignants, les glorias longuement
          battus." (Flaubert, Madame Bovary, 1857.)
