        <h1>Cold Brew Coffee</h1>
        <p>
          If you crave a good iced coffee in the summer, but loathe the way so
          many end up tasting watery or overly bitter, then there's only one
          solution: cold brew coffee. This method guarantees a smooth and icy
          cup, every time. Making cold brew coffee is no great secret, nor does
          it require the ninja-level skills of a trained barista in order to
          master. You don't even need much special equipment beyond a large
          container for making the coffee and a strainer.
