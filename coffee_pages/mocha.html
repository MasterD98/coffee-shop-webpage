        <h1>Mocha</h1>
        <p>
          Not to be confused with the Mocha coffee bean that originates in
          Yemen, the mocha or caffe mocha is a sweet, chocolate-laced coffee
          that has become a staple on worldwide coffee menus. The drink
          originated in the USA and take inspiration from a Turin coffee called
          the Bicern. A homage to the Red Sea coastal town of Mocha, Yemen,
          which has been exporting coffee since the fifteenth century. Coffee
          imported from the region was said to have a a rich chocolatey taste,
          hence the term 'mocha' being used to describe the addition of
          chocolate to this cappuccino hybrid. Very much like a cappuccino, the
          mocha contains a frothed milk that is often - but not always - topped
          with whipped cream. Made up of one third epsresso and two thirds
          steamed milk with cocoa powder added, it's no wonder that those with a
          sweet tooth opt for this luxurious choco-coffee drink. Relatively
          simple to make, the mocha is a great option for those that want a
          fusion between a luxurious hot chocolate and a normal latte/cappuccino
          and can't quite decide what to choose. There are a couple of ways to
          prepare a mocha, so a little bit of practice can be a valuable tool
          with this decadent milky coffee drink.
